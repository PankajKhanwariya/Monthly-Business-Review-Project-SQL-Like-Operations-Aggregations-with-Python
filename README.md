Hey there,
Posting the FULLY AUTOMATED and the most asked projects of all in Analytics field i.e. Monthly Review Business for 'X' brand which is fully Python libraries, calculations driven code and doing better crunching than SQL, and beating SQL in timely execution.
THE BEST PART OF BEING THIS AS FULLY AUTOMATED IS "NO NEED TO ENTER THE INPUT OF START & END DATE", code doing on it's OWN.
